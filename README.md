I have completed the task of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on dataset of Global Terrorism. I worked to find out the different kinds of attack, terrorist activity, target types and weapon types. Along with that I also found out the region where the attack was maximum. These insights into the data can help create awareness among the masses.
